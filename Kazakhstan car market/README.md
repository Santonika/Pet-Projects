##  Project Description

It's a pet project analyzing the Kazakhstan car market in 2019. The dataset includes information about car dealers, details of sold cars, their characteristics, prices, and sales regions. Due to the messy nature of the dataset, it was divided into two parts:

I Part: Data preprocessing:
The goal was to clean the dataframe, fill in missing data as much as possible, and ensure all columns were in the correct datatype.

II Part: Data analysis:
The objectives were:

  * Determine market capacity, identify market leaders in brands and companies, and analyze regional statistics.
  * Compare commercial and private market segments.
  * Perform RFM analysis by brands and models.
  * Conduct marketing analysis for the company Mercur.
  * Provide recommendations for future strategies.
